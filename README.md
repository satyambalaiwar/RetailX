Or use the built-in Jupyter support in VS Code.

- Explore revenue, profit, trends, and customer insights.
- All plots use Seaborn’s modern themes for clarity.

## 🚀 Deployment

To deploy or share your analysis:

1. **Export notebook results:**  
   - Save plots and summaries as images or PDF from Jupyter.

2. **Share cleaned data:**  
   - Use `retail_sales_cleaned.csv` for further analytics or dashboards.

3. **Version control:**  
   - Commit your changes and push to GitHub:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Update analysis and data"
     git push origin main
